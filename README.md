# Spiking_Hopfield_Network
A spiking neural network implementation of the Hopfield Network using PyTorch and snnTorch. This project reconstructs original images from noisy inputs by leveraging biologically inspired Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons and Hebbian learning principles. Tested across multiple datasets like Sklearn Images, MNIST, Fashion MNIST, and Road Signs
